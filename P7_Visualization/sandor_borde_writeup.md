## Summary
Donald J. Trump won the presidential election in 2016, but for many, it was an unexpected result. If we look at the financial support came from California we see that Hillary Clinton got far more support than her competitor. After breaking down the data maybe we can get some idea of Trump's supporters.

## Design
On the first slide, I show two lines on a plot which represent the sum of daily support for both candidates. I put a slider next to the plot with which the user can adjust the time interval. The line graph will highlight the fact that Clinton received more and more support all the time except two days in the Summer of 2016.

On the second slide, I will show two bar with the cumulative sum of support for both candidates. I use the bar-chart because it stresses the difference between them.

Next to the previous plot, I put a pie-chart which represents the occupation ratio of the supporters. Here we can see that retirees made the 20% of the support. Later, we can compare this ratio to the per-candidate ratios.

On the third slide, I will show two plots next to each other. A pie chart which shows Donald Trump's supporters' occupation ratio where we can realize that retirees made 50% of the contribution for him, so this occupation is a bit over-represented.

On the second plot, there will be a bar chart where I display the average amount per support check. Here we can see that CEO's didn't donate too much in total, but each contribution was quite high on average.

On the last slide, I will show a map of California, where I will display with circles of different sizes the amount of support received from each city. With a radio button, we can choose between the two candidates. Switching between them, we can realize that Trump's support wasn't so concentrated in large cities but spread across California.
