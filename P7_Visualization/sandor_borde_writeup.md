# Visualisation project writeup

## Summary
Donald J. Trump won the presidential election in 2016, but for many, it was an unexpected result. If we look at the financial support came from California we see that Hillary Clinton got far more support than her competitor. After breaking down the data maybe we can get some idea of Trump's supporters.

## Design
On the first view, I show two lines on a plot which represent the sum of daily support for both candidates. I put a slider next to the plot with which the user can adjust the time interval. The line graph will highlight the fact that Clinton received more and more support all the time except two days in the Summer of 2016.

On the second view, I will show two bar with the cumulative sum of support for both candidates. I use the bar-chart because it stresses the difference between them.

On the third view, I put a pie-chart which represents the proportion of support given to Trump for occupation group which made at least the 1% of the donation. Here we can see that retirees made the 31% of the support, and wealthy people (CEO, business owner, realtor) gave a significant amount.

### Solution for Feedback 1:
I grouped the same or very similar occupations, and filtered out which were smaller than 1%.

On the fourth slide, I will show a scatter plot. On the X axis I display the sum of contribution made by an occupation, on the Y axis I show the average donation amount for the same occupation (both only for D. Trump).
Here we can see that wealthier people (Business Owner, Sales) and people from top management (CEO, President) contributed a low amount in total, but they gave relatively large average amount per donation.

### Solution for Feedback 2:
I changed the wording because it was misleading.

On the last slide, I will show a map of California, where I will display with circles of different sizes the amount of support received from each city. With a radio button, we can choose between the two candidates. Switching between them, we can realize that Trump's support wasn't so concentrated in large cities but spread across California.

### Solution for Feedback 3:
I grouped the occupations which can be considered together.

## Feedback
### Feedback 1:

"Third chart: You have many occupations, and it's difficult to distinguish them. Can you make groups? This way, you would have few groups, but we could distinguish them. I think it would be easier for the reader to understand."

### Feedback 2:
"I couldn't understand the fourth chart. I can't see why the contributions are less frequent but have large amounts. I mean, I can't reach this conclusion just looking at the chart. Maybe I'm missing something. Could you explain it to me?"

### Feedback 3:
"I would make a small adjustment in the fourth chart. Put color on the dots because it's easier for the reader to understand. For example, you can create two groups: The first group has Self-employed, Business owner, realtor, CEO, executive, manager, and president. The second group has the rest of the occupations. So, in the graph, we can see that one group is different from another. because of the color. The way it is today, I need to hover over the dots to discover the occupation."
